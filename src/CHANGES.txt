Forge Beta: 07-15-2011 ver 1.1.00 SVN rev #

(Quest icons used created by Teekatas, from his Legendora set 

http://raindropmemory.deviantart.com)

# cards in total.

This version is based upon the revision number # which is found on our SVN.


This version and future versions will require java 6. There may still be a few people who are unable to install java 6 on the computer that they use to run the forge application. These people will have to use forge version 1.0.15. Forge version 1.1.00 and above will require java 6.

Work on the new card scripting system is ongoing. We have new code to handle auras and cards with static abilities. This is a work in progress and it is not yet finished in this version.

Rob and Marc have worked together to add in a new feature which will overlay a card's image with a foil like film. A few random cards will have a foil like image in constructed mode games and possibly quest mode games. There is a check box on the New Game window that you can use to turn this feature on or off.

This version includes a large number of new cards from Magic 2012. Card images for these new cards are not yet available. We hope that these images will come online in a few weeks. Until then, please be patient.


We have changed the archiving format to ".tar.bz2". There are utilities for Windows, Mac OS and the various *nix's that can be used to decompress these archives.


The Mac OS application version:

We have packaged the Forge 07/15/2011 BETA version as a Mac OS application. You can double click the Forge.app icon to launch the forge application on your Apple computer running Mac OS. This application will automatically increase the java heap space memory for you as it launches. This version does not require the forge.command file and it does not need to start the Terminal application as part of the start up process. This version should only require java 1.5.

You can move a copy of your pictures and decks over to the Forge.app application. Right click or control click on the Forge.app icon. Select Show Package Contents form the contextual menu. A Finder window will open and will display a folder named Contents. Navigate to the folder:

/Contents/Resources/Java/res/

Your decks can be placed in the decks folder, your pics can be placed in the pics folder, etc.


Fixes/Features:

- Clean up unused methods.
- More cleanup of deprecated classes. Eventually will move in what is still used into the current classes.
- Cleaned the changes.txt file.
- Beginning of the end for hard-coded Magic-specific lists. CardTypes and Non-Stacking Keywords are taken out of CardUtil. Probably not the best idea to hack the Constant object to hold dynamic data, but it works until someone else can do better.
- Added foiling option for constructed mode. Approximately 1:6 cards will be foiled with this option turned on.
- Added AF_ProtectionAll (should be the same params as AF_Protection with a ValidCards; it is not targeted for players at this point.)

- Issue 143 (ongoing). Reduce heap allocation by switching some data structures from Hash to Tree implementations. Advocate for use of new immutable iterator instead of getCards and getAllCards. The former grants unsafe access to the card database, and the latter uses a lot of heap space.
- Fixed Trigger_Always.getCopy().

- Converted I and J cards from stPumpAll to StaticEffect
- Little fix.
- Converted most H cards from stPumpAll to StaticEffect.
- Issue 143 (ongoing). Estimated significant heap relief via removal of TWO unnecessary temporary lists in ReadCard, one of all card names and the other of all Card instances! Promoted ReadCard.zipFile from static bottom-feeder to classic homestyle member field. ReadCard now loads card directly into CardFactory's map; this means less code overall. Added some Javadoc describing CardFactory's use of two permanent Card collections. Changed field types in CardFactory to interface types. Removed silly progress bar from CardFactory.getAllCards; it was a very fast operation to begin with, plus its existence may have inadvertently promoted further unwanted use of getAllCards. Improved implementation of CardFactory's iterator method to act more like getCards and blessed it with Javadoc. Removed dead code, and commented out code that is unused according to Eclipse.
- Converted most G cards from stPumpAll to StaticEffect.
- Ultra minor. Remove unused import.
- Issue 143, ongoing. Accomplish some TODO items to use less temporary heap space by changing one-time iterations over CardFactory.getCards or CardFactory.getAllCards to use CardFactory.iterator instead.
- Converted most F cards from stPumpAll to StaticEffect.
- Adding some Basic AI for Attach Pump.
- Convert Holy Strength to AF_Attach.
- Progress monitor suite: Rename base interface to avoid name conflict with javax.swing.ProgressMonitor. Add dispose method.
- Added a size method to help progress monitors.
- Issue 143, ongoing. Use CardFactory.iterator in forge.GUI_Filter. Using the Filter *menu* in the deck editor to filter by name is now quite fast. Changed forge.CardFilter.cardListNameFilter's name to lower case, and changed it to accept an Iterable<Card> as its first argument instead of a CardList; because the latter implements the former, this makes the method usable in more situations without significantly changing any calls to it. Added style TODO items to the rest of the methods in forge.CardFilter.
- Issue 143, ongoing. More support for Iterator<Card> versus CardList. Add static method forge.CardList.filter(Iterable<Card>,CardFilter) to perform same actions on an Iterable<Card>; reimplement nonstatic method forge.CardList.filter(CardFilter) in terms of the former.
- Issue 143, ongoing. Use less heap by creating fewer large temporary lists of cards, favoring CardFactory.iterator instead. Eliminated one such list in each of these two files for generating 2 and 3 color decks.
- Ran set info script.
- Added proper handling of state triggers. (No intervening if-check, no going on the stack twice.)
- Cleaned up overzealous autocomplete.
- Holy Strength now uses "Creature.EnchantedBy" not "AttachedBy".
- Changed clearFirstSpellAbility to clearFirstSpell and change the functionality to match. Fixing an issue for Auras that gained an Ability before their enPump Spell.
- Converted Snake Umbra to Attach.
- Little fix Lord of the Undead.
- AI now checking Targetability in Attach.
- Added EnchantedBy, Enchanted, EquippedBy, and Equipped in the same vein as Attached{By} to hasProperty.
- Added the option "CharacteristicDefining" to continuous static effects.
- Added the options "SetPower" and "SetToughness" to continuous static effects.
- Converted Crowd of Cinders.
- Touch up for Kabira Vindicator.
- Converted E cards from stPumpAll to StaticEffect.
- Fixed Snake Umbra cost.
- Issue 143, ongoing. Reduced temporary heap usage by changing GeneratedConstructedDeck.getCards to use CardFactory.iterator instead of CardFactory.getAllCards. Changed GeneratedConstructedDeck.filterBadCards to operate on an Iterable<Card> instead of only a CardList. Updated Javadoc for both.
- Little fix.
- Issue 143, ongoing. Reduced temporary heap usage by changing GeneratedConstructedMultiColorDeck.getCards to use CardFactory.iterator instead of CardFactory.getAllCards. Changed GeneratedConstructedMultiColorDeck.filterBadCards to operate on an Iterable<Card> instead of only a CardList. Updated Javadoc for both.
- Added M12 to blocks and setdata.
- Imporved variable names in CardDetailPanel.java.
- Removed the period at the end of a keyword on some cards. We really need to standardize this.
- Converted Mul Daya Channelers to script.
- Fixed some cards.
- Converted some simple enPumps to AF_Attach + StaticAbility.
- Little fixes.
- Updated some general utilities in preparation for my next commit. Add two functions to GeneratorFunctions for performing lazy deferred operations on products of a generator.
- Converted most D cards from stPumpAll to StaticEffect
- Converted some simple enPumps to AF_Attach + StaticAbility.
- Added CardList(Generator<Card>), a constructor that accepts a Card Generator. Fixed typo CardList(int).
- Issue 143, ongoing. This is one of my bigger changes; further testing would be appreciated. Fixed deprecated calls to CardFactory.getAllCards. Changed forge.NameChanger's fields from HashMap to TreeMap. Changed NameChanger.changeCard to use Generators instead of arrays. Added NameChanger.changeCardsIfNeeded to perform a routine operation I noticed in a few other files. Updated other classes' method calls to use changeCardsIfNeeded. Created another version of forge.gui.GuiUtils.getChoiceOptional that takes an Iterator instead of varargs/ellipsis (...). Disambiguated top and bottom parameters from same named fields in forge.Gui_CardShop.updateDisplay. Updated and repaired Javadoc of most changed methods.
- Fix serialVersionUID compiler warning. Does this have something to do with others' recent troubles running the latest SVN?
- Converted C cards from stPumpAll to StaticEffect.
- Removed Chaos Warp.
- Converted some simple enPumps to AF_Attach + StaticAbility.
- Replace CardList(CardList) constructor with 100\% compatible CardList(Iterable\<Card\>). It might be a little slower, but it's more dynamic because it uses a less specific type. Wrote javadoc for this constructor.
- Issue 143, ongoing. I had to give in to duplicating the card database in CardLists when updating the GUI is involved. The results often get assigned to fields. Except for one in forge.Gui_DeckEditor_Menu, I changed most deprecated calls to CardFactory.getAllCards to new CardList(AllZone.getCardFactory()). I marked each with a comment that it "is an expensive heap operation." I was not sufficiently inspired to update javadoc :-(
- Converted some simple enPumps to AF_Attach + StaticAbility.
- Converted B cards from stPumpAll to StaticEffect.
- Renamed M10 and M11 in setdata.
- Housekeeping. Automatic refactor to move static filtering methods from forge.CardList to forge.CardFilter, which is where static filtering methods should be.

- Added selectRandom and solidify methods.
- Converted some simple enPumps to AF_Attach + StaticAbility.
- Added getColor filter.
- Converted some simple enPumps to AF_Attach + StaticAbility.
- Issue 143, ongoing. Significant structural changes to Quest card disbursements; please let me know if the randomness seems off. Converted much code from CardLists to Generators. Realized that I need to solidify (fully evaluate) these Generators at certain points, like when they're about to be traversed more than once. Updated some Javadoc, too.
- Fixed Sachi Daughter of Seshiro.
- Updated Magma Sliver (original SVars called X could have been overwritten).
- Updated some card text files.
- Tweaked Vengeful Pharaoh. I had some concerns about this card yesterday but I can't remember what they were..
- Cleanup: Removed the unused variables exaltedMagnitude, otherAttackBoost and otherDefenseBoost (together with their functions) from the card class.

- Removed the whole mumbo jumbo about topCardOfLibrary.
- Removed executeCardStateEffects (which was littered all over the code).
- Make sure "Number$" xCount takes into account additional math.
- Converted Mwonvuli Ooze to stSetPT (mostly so the math is there when it gets converted to static factory.)
- Further tweak displaying subtypes for Cards.
- Call updateObservers on each player in GuiDisplayUtil.updateGUI(). This fixes a problem where if you Swords to Plowshares one of compy's creatures, compy's Exile doesn't increment the displayed number in Exile zone until the next turn.
- Converted some simple enPumps to AF_Attach + StaticAbility.
- Ran set info script.
- Converted some simple enPumps to AF_Attach + StaticAbility.
- Fixed Kojak 1.
- AEther Adept didn't get reprint Info, am looking into scripts handling of AE cards.
- Converted some simple enPumps to AF_Attach + StaticAbility.

- Missed a null check in AF_Attach.
- More Attach cleanup, synchronizing how Card is selected with non-Pump Modes.
- Converted some simple enPumps to AF_Attach + StaticAbility.
- Starting at Z. Converted some cards from stPumpSelf to StaticEffect.

- Issue 143, ongoing. Converted the last of the main non-test uses of CardFactory.getAllCards. To support that, I create a new method, CardFactory.getRandomCombinationWithoutRepetition. Added unit test for new CardFactory method. ReadCard's unit test is vastly out of synch with its code, so I commented out most of it.
- Fixed wording of Brass Herald.
- Converted most V cards from stPumpSelf to StaticEffect.
- Fixed bad commit; restored history of CardFactory.java.
- Fixed bad commit. Restored history of CardFactoryTest.java; this adds back the change from r10616.

- Issue 143, ongoing. Reduce heap size by converting Hash variables and fields to Tree implementations and interface types.
- Issue 143, ongoing. In forge.Card, I converted Hashes to interface types and Tree implementations. This necessitated small changes in many other files, but I limited the changes to just what was needed. I will have to return to those files in a future revision to convert the rest of their Hashes and update their javadocs.
- Centralizing a bit more of the Attach code. A few more AI Improvements in Pump.

- Re-integrate substance.jar. This highlights a problem with dependency management. Maven has no problem with newer versions of the library since it automatically pulls in the deps. Eclipse (without using the Maven plugin) and the svn bat script forces the use of an older dep since the older version of substance has everything bundled in.
- Updated testng in pom.xml. Applied pach to build.xml ( issue 150 ).

- Converted some enPumps to AF_Attach + StaticAbility.

- Fixed typo in PlayCard.
- Added TinyTest.java, which helps make sure TestNG is working as expected.
