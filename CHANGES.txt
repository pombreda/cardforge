Forge Beta: 06-24-2011 ver 1.0.14 SVN rev 10003

(Quest icons used created by Teekatas, from his Legendora set

8437 cards in total.

This version is based upon the revision # 10003 which is found on our SVN.


This version features a complete rewrite of Sealed Deck mode. Full cardpool, block and custom modes are supported. Custom sealed files in the res/sealed folder are exactly the same as custom draft files, except the file extension ".sealed".

A distinction may now be made between AI decks and Human decks, with the addition of a deck Metadata "PlayerType", which right now just helps by sorting human decks into the human combo box and AI decks into the AI combo box.

Rob fixed the main Deck Editor's bad behavior with cards reappearing in the top after clearing the filter. A similar change should be easy to apply to the quest deck editor.

A number of bugs are fixed in this version. This includes the multi-targeting bug and the Trigger issue is now fixed. Many of the auras were missing potions of the descriptive text which appears in the card detail panel. After a lot of head scratching we believe that we have implemented a quick fix for this version.

The keyword "CARDNAME can't be the target of spells or abilities your opponents control." was replaced with the new shortened "Hexproof" keyword. There are several new and sveral revamped quest opponent decks.


We have changed the archiving format to ".tar.bz2". There are utilities for Windows, Mac OS and the various *nix's that can be used to decompress these archives.


The Mac OS application version:

We have packaged the Forge 06/24/2011 BETA version as a Mac OS application. You can double click the Forge.app icon to launch the forge application on your Apple computer running Mac OS. This application will automatically increase the java heap space memory for you as it launches. This version does not require the forge.command file and it does not need to start the Terminal application as part of the start up process. This version should only require java 1.5.

You can move a copy of your pictures and decks over to the Forge.app application. Right click or control click on the Forge.app icon. Select Show Package Contents form the contextual menu. A Finder window will open and will display a folder named Contents. Navigate to the folder:

/Contents/Resources/Java/res/

Your decks can be placed in the decks folder, your pics can be placed in the pics folder, etc.
